          <h1>Welcome to Knit To Knit!</h1>
          <p>
              Knitting can involve a lot of detailed calculations and math, my goal is to create a tool to handle the
              math allowing you to focus on the creating. Hi I'm Marco, the creator of Knit To Knit. I wanted to create a tool that
              handles the calculations and resizing so you can dive into your designs and bring your ideas to life
              without worry.
          </p>
          <h4>A little about me</h4>
          <p>
              I’m a sophomore at Belmont University, trying to balance studies and my passion to
              create. Right now, it’s just me here at Knit To Knit, working hard to bring
              you resources that make knitting more straightforward and enjoyable. Every tool, pattern, and update is
              crafted with the hope of adding something valuable to your knitting journey. I’m truly honored to be part
              of your process, one stitch at a time.
          </p>
