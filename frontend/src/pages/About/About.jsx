          <h1>Welcome to Knit To Knit!</h1>
          <p>
              Hi there! I’m Marco Cassar, the person behind Knit To Knit. My goal with this
              website and tool is simple: to help you focus on what you love—creating. Knitting can involve a lot of
              detail and math, which can sometimes get in the way of the joy of crafting. I wanted to create a tool that
              handles the calculations and resizing so you can dive into your designs and bring your ideas to life
              without worry.
          </p>
          <h4>A little about me</h4>
          <p>
              I’m a sophomore at Belmont University, trying to balance studies and my passion to
              create. Right now, it’s just me here at Knit To Knit, working hard to bring
              you resources that make knitting more straightforward and enjoyable. Every tool, pattern, and update is
              crafted with the hope of adding something valuable to your knitting journey. I’m truly honored to be part
              of your process, one stitch at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
              Thank you for supporting this small project and joining a growing community of knitters. Whether you’re a
              seasoned knitter or just picking up needles for the first time, I hope you find something here that makes
              your experience even better.
          </p>
          <p>Happy knitting!</p>
          <p>— Marco</p>
